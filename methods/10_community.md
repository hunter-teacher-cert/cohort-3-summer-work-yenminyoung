### Organization: Girls Who Code

#### How It Works
Worldwide organization that aims to close the gender gap in tech.
* Offers at curriculum throughout the school year to be implemented in a female-focused space.
* ALL genders are welcome, as long as you are aligned with the mission andn values
* Values: Bravery, Sisterhood, and Activism
* Connects students with female professionals in tech
* Fun activities, build community


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* Encouraging more females to join CS classes and see themselves as coders
* Giving females an opportunity to be more confident in their voice and mind, explore their creativity, and feel empowered to make an impact in their world

#### Rollout Timeline
* Interest meeting in September
* Meet once (or twice?) a month until June for one hour

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Within the first year:
  * Have at least 5 members
  * Have at least 3 different grades represented
  * At least 1/4 of the members was someone who didn't see themselves as a coder, but is sticking with it after they tried it out
* After the first year:
  * It's presence is known on campus and other teachers know to encourage students to join
  * Culture of mentorship (older student3s connecting with and supporting younger students)
  * Size has increased by 150%
* Undefined time markers:
  * More student leadership and ownership of the club
  * More graduates choosing CS majors
  * At least 50% of CS classes are female
  * Females are more outspoken and confident in CS classes

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Conversations with males who are butt-hurt about not having a coding club
* It's ANOTHER thing for me to do. I am already very overwhelmed
* Getting it started is (in my opinion) the hardest part
* Should this be separated by MS and HS?
* Will I get per session?
