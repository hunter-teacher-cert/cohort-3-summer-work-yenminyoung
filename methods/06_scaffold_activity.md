Analogy:
Defining a function is like creating a blueprint to make recreate something, but also customize it a bit! For example, let's look at how to make pancakes

function draw(){
  breakfast(apples, cinnamon, 5)
}

function breakfast(fruit, sweetener, number){
  mix (fruit) into batter
  cook (number) pancakes
  add pancake to stack
  add (sweetener) on top
  return plate of pancakes + newspaper
}
