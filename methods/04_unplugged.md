## Unplugged Activity
Team M&Ms (Marisa & Masters): Marisa Shuman, Jessica Novillo Argudo, Harrison Fung, Yenmin Young

### Topic: Variables and Reassignment

### Background
Students often have a difficult time understanding what a variable is at first and how it stores a value (and that value can be changed). This lesson is hopefully going to reinforce these concepts.

### Participant pre-requisites
It will be most helpful if students understand the definitions of a noun, verb and adjective (this can also be reviewed as a brainstarter).

### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* We suggest giving some students whiteboards for this activity (or potentially laminating the worksheet) so that students can actually erase the original values of the variables.
* Small groups of 2-4 students


### Go!

Potential containers: locker, bowl, box, desk drawer
Madlibs sentence skeleton: 

My cat likes to `pinkBox`.
For lunch, I ate `locker2` with a `glassBowl`.
Once upon a time, there was a `topDrawer` `desk4`.
Today's weather is `greenBox` so I went to the `phoneBox` and had a `computerCart` day.

Words are taped inside the containers.
`pinkBox` = play
`locker2` = pizza
`glassBowl` = spoon
`topDrawer` = slimy
`desk4` = frog
`greenBox` = humid
`phoneBox` = beach
`computerCart` = great

- Round 1, teachers determine the words.
Students fill out the worksheet with the teacher-designated words. They have to go find the words in the correct spot. Debrief: a variable is a container that stores something.

- Round 2, students are split in 8 groups. Each group is responsible for giving a new value to their container. Redo the scavenger hunt and see how the story has changed. Debrief: Focus on reassignment. FORGET the old value. Erased from memory.

- Round 3
`locker2` = `desk4` Debrief: you can reassign a variable to hold a value of a different varaible

- Round 4 
`computerCart` = `topDrawer`
`topDrawer` = huge
Debrief: Be careful about the order of your code. At that line of code, computerCart will hold the value of whatever is in topDrawer, but will not be constantly updating.

- Round 5
classic CS (P)/math questions:
x = 3
y = 10
z = x + y
x = y
y = z - x
What is x, y, and z?
Scaffold: make 3 empty boxes labeled with x, y, and z, and give them a pencil with eraser! (Or use whiteboards or laminated sheets)
