## Teacher-Facing Notes
Address specifics how the groupwork component will be worked in.
* What are the intended benefits of groupwork over solo work?
* Mechanisms for gauging how well it is working?
* What to do when trouble erupts... (resistance to a grouping, lack of buy-in, "dead-weight" teammates, know-it-alls, etc.)
* What instructions/guidance will students get re: the groupwork mechanics?
* What long-term or class-wide goals does this support, and how?
