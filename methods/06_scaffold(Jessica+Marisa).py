## 1. Define a function called good_game that takes in a number of coins that Mario earned.

function good_game(number){
  if (number == 0){
  return "Better luck next time!";
  } else {
    return "Nice job earning those coins Mario.";
  }
}

#If Mario didn't collect any coins, return "Better luck next time".
#If Mario earned ANY coins, return "Nice job earning those coins Mario".

# CALL YOUR FUNCTION AT LEAST THREE TIMES!





## 2. Write a function called better_game that takes in a number of coins that Mario earned.

function good_game(number){
  if (number < 20){
  return "You got a few coins, get more next time!";
  } else if (number > 20){
  return "Congrats on earning a lot of coins!";
  } else if (number == 20){
  return "20 is a good amount.";
  } 
}

#If Mario earned fewer than 20 coins, return "You got a few coins, get more next time!"
#If Mario earned exactly 20 coins, return "20 is a good amount."
#If Mario earned more than 20 coins, return "Congrats on earning a lot of coins!"

#CALL YOUR FUNCTION AT LEAST THREE TIMES!




############ MEDIUM ############

##3. Eventually we want to make the goal adjustable. Write a function called coin_goal_tracker that takes in two parameters (a goal number of coins and the amount of coins Mario collected)

#If the goal number of coins is larger than the current amount of coins, return "Sorry you didn't make your goal :("
#If the goal number of coins is equal to the current amount of coins, return "You hit your goal! NICE!"
#If the goal number of coins is smaller than the current amount of coins, return "Congrats, you beat your goal!"

#CALL YOUR FUNCTION AT LEAST THREE TIMES!

function coin_goal_tracker(goal, coins){
  if (coins<goal){
  return "Sorry you didn't make your goal :(";
  } else if (coins > goal){
  return "Congrats, you beat your goal!";
  } else if (coins == goal){
  return "You hit your goal! NICE!";
  } 
}

## 4. Advanced levels of Mario also have powerups which make Mario stronger! 

#Define a function called coin_power_ups that takes in two parameters (a number of coins and a number of power ups).

#If Mario got NO coins and NO powerups, return "You should try to get something next time!"
#If Mario got some coins but NO power ups, return "Great job with the coins, next time try to get some power ups!"
#If Mario got more coins than they did power ups, return "So many, I wonder if you can buy power ups..."
#If Mario got the same amount of power ups and coins, return "Nicely done, same amount for power ups and coins!"
#If Mario got more power ups than coins, return "But coins help you win! Get more!"

#CALL YOUR FUNCTION AT LEAST FIVE TIMES!

function coin_power_ups(coins, powerUps){
  if (coins == 0 && powerUps == 0){
    return "You should try to get something next time!";
  } else if (coins > 0 && powerUps == 0){
    return "Great job with the coins, next time try to get some power ups!";
  } else if (coins > powerUps){
    return "So many... I wonder if you can buy power ups...";
  } else if (coins == powerUps){
    return "Nicely done, same amount for power ups and coins!";
  } else if (powerUps > coins){
    return "But coins help you win. Get more!";
  }
}
